## Description
  
In need of a simple logo for your project, site, or other application? Look no further than the SVG logo maker. Answer a few questions on the command line and a .svg file will be generated. When added to html or opened on its own in the browser of your choice, a 300x200 pixel image will be generated with your choice of characters, surrounding shape, and both text and background colors!

## Installation
  
You must have node installed on your machine for this program to run. To check if you have node already installed, run the following code in your terminal:

`node --version`

If you see something like (but perhaps different numbers for another version)

`v18.18.2`

you're all set! If not, enter the following:

`npm init -y`

followed by 

`npm i`

Make sure you also have the 'inquirer' package. Very important! The program will be unable to prompt you for information without this package. Run this command to install inquirer:

`npm i --save inquirer@8.2.4`

Once you've done all of that, you are good to go!
  
## Usage
  
Use the command line to navigate to the directory where the program is located. Then, type the following command in your terminal:

`node index.js`

Follow the prompts and answer the questions. Note: you may enter a simple color name (i.e. blue, red, orange) or a hex value preceeded by a '#' (i.e. #FFFFFF, #102040). The program will wait for a value of these types before proceeding.

At the end, you should get the following message:

`Generated logo.svg`

Your .svg file will be located in the folder titled "YourSVGFolder" (so you don't mix it up with your friend's folder). Feel free to use the file how you please!
